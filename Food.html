<h1>popular food in Egypt</h1>
<h2>Koshari</h2>
<p>Carb overload coming right at you! Come lunch time in Cairo you’ll
    see a stack of locals lined up at every kushari shop around, waiting
    for a hearty portion of one of Egypt’s favourite street foods. This
    filling meal is made up of rice, macaroni and lentils, topped with
    tomato sauce, garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and fried
    onions. It’s a perfect meal that is substantial, nutrient-packed and
    cheap. Exactly what the Egyptians were after! </p>

    <h2> Shawrma</h2>

    <p> It consists of thinly sliced, slow-roasted meat,
         typically lamb, beef, or chicken, wrapped in pita bread and topped with various 
         condiments and fresh vegetables. The meat is often cooked on a vertical spit, resulting in a
          succulent and flavourful experience.</p>
